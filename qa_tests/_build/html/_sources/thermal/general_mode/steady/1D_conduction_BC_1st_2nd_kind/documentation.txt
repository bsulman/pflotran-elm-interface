The Problem Description
=======================

This problem is adapted from *Kolditz, et al. (2015), 
Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical-Chemical Processes in Fractured Porous Media: 
Modelling and Benchmarking, Closed Form Solutions, Springer International 
Publishing, Switzerland.* Section 2.1.2, pg.15, "A 1D Steady-State 
Temperature Distribution, Boundary Conditions of 1st and 2nd Kind."

The domain is a 100x10x10 meter rectangular beam extending along the positive 
x-axis and is made up of 10x1x1 cubic grid cells with dimensions 10x10x10 
meters. The domain is composed of two materials and is assigned the following 
properties: thermal conductivity *K1(x<2L/5)* = 100 W/(m-C); thermal 
conductivity *K2(x>2L/5)* = 300 W/(m-C); specific heat capacity *Cp* = 0.001 
J/(m-C); density *rho* = 2,800 kg/m^3.

The temperature is initially uniform at *T(t=0)* = 1.0C.
The boundary temperature at the left end is *T(x=0)* = 1.0C and a heat flux 
*q(x=L)* = -1.5 W/m^2 is applied at the right end, where L = 100 m.
The simulation is run until the steady-state temperature distribution
develops. 

The LaPlace equation governs the steady-state temperature distribution,

.. math:: {{\partial^{2} T} \over {\partial x^{2}}} = 0

The solution is given by,

.. math:: 

   T(x<2L/5) = a_1 x + b_1
   
   T(x>2L/5) = a_2 x + b_2

When the boundary conditions *T(x=0)* = 1.0C and *q(x=L)* = -1.5 W/m^2 are 
applied, the solution becomes,

.. math:: 

   T(x<2L/5) = -{{qx} \over {K1}} + T(x=0)
   
   T(x>2L/5) = -{{qx} \over {K2}} + T(x=0) + {{2qL} \over {5}}\left({1 \over K2}-{1 \over K1}\right)

The PFLOTRAN Input File
=======================
The PFLOTRAN input file can be downloaded 
:download:`here <./1D_conduction_BC_1st_2nd_kind.in>`.

The ``SIMULATION`` Block
------------------------
The ``SIMULATION`` block indicates the type of simulation we are running, the
process models we are including, and whether we want an input record file 
printed::

  SIMULATION
    SIMULATION_TYPE SUBSURFACE
    PROCESS_MODELS
      SUBSURFACE_FLOW flow
        MODE GENERAL
      /
    /
    #INPUT_RECORD_FILE
  END
    
In this test, we are running a flow subsurface simulation in GENERAL
mode. We call the simulation ``SUBSURFACE``.
We call the subsurface flow process model ``flow``. 
We have commented out the input record file option.

The ``SUBSURFACE`` Block
------------------------
Next, the ``SUBSURFACE`` block begins with the block-opening statement, and 
closes with a block-ending statement::

  SUBSURFACE   
    . . .
    . . .
  END_SUBSURFACE
   
The block-opening statement begins immediately after the ``SIMULATION``
block ends, but you will not see the block-ending statement until the bottom
of this input file because this block is very large. 
Within the ``SUBSURFACE`` block, several cards are required that describe the
simulation we want to run. 

The ``GRID`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The problem domain is a beam of conductive material that consists of 
10x1x1 grid cells. Each cell is a 10x10x10 m cube, making the dimensions
of the domain 100x1x1 m. We can describe this domain via a structured grid::

  GRID
    TYPE structured
    NXYZ 10 1 1
    DXYZ
     10
     10
     10
    END
  END
  
The keyword ``NXYZ`` indicates the number of grid cells in the x, y, and z
directions. The keywork ``DXYZ`` indicates the dimensions of each grid cell
in the x, y, and z directions. Note the ``DXYZ`` keyword is a sub-block within 
the ``GRID`` card, so it must be closed with an ``END``.

The ``REGION`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next we describe regions and boundaries of the domain with ``REGION`` cards
for each region or boundary. Since the domain consists of two materials, 
we first create a region called ``left`` and assign it with
``COORDINATES`` that define a box-like volume which defines region ``left``.
Region ``left`` contains the domain where x < 2L/5 and is assigned K1
thermal conductivity. Similarly, we create a region called ``right`` which
contains the domain where x > 2L/5 and is assigned K2 thermal conductivity::

  REGION left
    COORDINATES
      0.d0   0.d0   0.d0
      40.d0  10.d0  10.d0
    /
  END
  
  REGION right
    COORDINATES
      40.d0   0.d0   0.d0
      100.d0  10.d0  10.d0
    /
  END
  
We will apply boundary conditions to the left and right (or west and east) ends
of the domain, so we also define these boundaries now with a ``REGION`` card.
Because these are boundaries, the coordinates define a face. We call the regions
``left_end`` and ``right_end`` and indicate they are faces with the ``FACE`` 
keyword::

  REGION left_end
    FACE WEST
    COORDINATES
      0.d0  0.d0   0.d0
      0.d0  10.d0  10.d0
    /
  END

  REGION right_end
    FACE EAST
    COORDINATES
      100.d0  0.d0   0.d0
      100.d0  10.d0  10.d0
    /
  END

The ``MATERIAL_PROPERTY`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, we describe the material properties within the domain with the
``MATERIAL_PROPERTY`` card. Because this is a conduction test, we intentionally
limit fluid flow by setting the porosity to a very small value, as well as the
permeability (assumed units m^2). In this problem, we have two materials, so
we have two ``MATERIAL_PROPERTY`` cards:: 

  MATERIAL_PROPERTY beam_left
    ID 1
    POROSITY 1.d-5
    TORTUOSITY 1.d0
    ROCK_DENSITY 2.8E3 kg/m^3
    HEAT_CAPACITY 1.d-3 J/kg-C
    THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY_DRY 100 W/m-C
    THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY_WET 100 W/m-C
    CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES cc1
    PERMEABILITY
      PERM_X 1.d-20
      PERM_Y 1.d-20
      PERM_Z 1.d-20
    /
  END
  
  MATERIAL_PROPERTY beam_right
    ID 2
    POROSITY 1.d-5
    TORTUOSITY 1.d0
    ROCK_DENSITY 2.8E3 kg/m^3
    HEAT_CAPACITY 1.d-3 J/kg-C
    THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY_DRY 300 W/m-C
    THERMAL_CONDUCTIVITY_WET 300 W/m-C
    CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES cc1
    PERMEABILITY
      PERM_X 1.d-20
      PERM_Y 1.d-20
      PERM_Z 1.d-20
    /
  END
  
Both materials are identical except for the value of thermal conductivity.
The material density is 2,800 kg/m^3, the heat capacity is 0.001 J/kg-C, and 
the thermal conductivity is set to 100 W/m-C for the left part of the beam,
and 300 W/m-C for the right part of the beam. To differentiate the two
materials, we call one material ``beam_left`` and the other ``beam_right``,
and we assign them different material IDs. We assign both materials
a ``CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES`` called ``cc1``, which is later defined with the 
``CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES`` card.

The ``CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Because this is a thermal conduction only test, the ``CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES`` 
card should not matter, but it is required for the ``SUBSURFACE_FLOW`` process 
model. We call this card ``cc1``, which is consistent with the name in
the ``MATERIAL_PROPERTY`` cards. We assign it a ``VAN_GENUCHTEN`` saturation
function, and set typical values for the residual saturation, and M and alpha 
parameters::

  CHARACTERISTIC_CURVES cc1
    SATURATION_FUNCTION VAN_GENUCHTEN
      LIQUID_RESIDUAL_SATURATION 0.5d-1
      M 0.75
      ALPHA 1.d-3
    /
    PERMEABILITY_FUNCTION MUALEM
      LIQUID_RESIDUAL_SATURATION 0.1d0
      M 0.5d0
    /
    PERMEABILITY_FUNCTION MUALEM_VG_GAS
      LIQUID_RESIDUAL_SATURATION 0.1d0
      GAS_RESIDUAL_SATURATION 0.1d0
      M 0.5d0
    /
  END

The ``STRATA`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``STRATA`` card links the materials we have defined with the
``MATERIAL_PROPERTY`` cards to the regions we defined with the ``REGION`` 
cards::

  STRATA
    REGION left
    MATERIAL beam_left
  END
  
  STRATA
    REGION right
    MATERIAL beam_right
  END
  
The ``FLUID_PROPERTY`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The diffusion coefficient (in units of m2/s) for the fluid must be set in 
GENERAL mode. Since this is a conduction-only problem, this card doesn't 
really matter, but we must include it::

  FLUID_PROPERTY
    DIFFUSION_COEFFICIENT 1.d-9
  END

The ``OUTPUT`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here we define what kind of output we want to be generated. We want a 
``SNAPSHOT_FILE``, which is a snapshot of the domain at a specific time.
Because we do not specify specific variables, the default list of variables
for the snapshots will be generated::

  OUTPUT
    SNAPSHOT_FILE
      NO_PRINT_INITIAL
      #NO_PRINT_FINAL
      FORMAT VTK
    /
  END

Since this is a steady-state simulation, we do not need output of the initial 
state at t=0, so we've indicated ``NO_PRINT_INITIAL``. However, we *do* want
output at the end of the simulation, so we've commented out
``NO_PRINT_FINAL``. The output format will be VTK.

The ``TIME`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``TIME`` card controls the timestepping and the simulation time. This
problem tests a steady state solution, so we run the simulation out to a
time after which the solution no longer changes (it has become steady). For 
this problem, 100 years is long enough::

  TIME
    FINAL_TIME 100 yr
    INITIAL_TIMESTEP_SIZE 1.d-4 day
    MAXIMUM_TIMESTEP_SIZE 2.d0 yr at 0.d0 yr
  END
  
We chose a maximum timestep size of 2 years, applied at the beginning of the
simulation, and also set a small initial timestep size. Because we commented 
out ``NO_PRINT_FINAL`` in the ``OUTPUT`` card, a snapshot file will be generated
at the final time of 100 years.

The ``FLOW_CONDITION`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, we want to indicate the specifics of the initial and boundary conditions
for this problem. We need to specify an initial temperature and pressure. We 
do this with the ``FLOW_CONDITION`` card::

  FLOW_CONDITION initial
    TYPE
      TEMPERATURE dirichlet
      LIQUID_PRESSURE dirichlet
      MOLE_FRACTION dirichlet
    /
    TEMPERATURE 1.0d0 C
    LIQUID_PRESSURE 101325 Pa
    MOLE_FRACTION 1.d-10
  END
  
Here we've called the flow condition ``initial`` because it is the initial 
condition. In the ``TYPE`` sub-block, we specific the type of initial condition
for each parameter. In this case, we want the domain to have an initial 
temperature of 1.0C, so the flow condition type for temperature is ``dirichlet``. 
We set the liquid pressure to atmospheric (101325 Pa), which is also a ``dirichlet`` 
type. We set the gas mole fraction to a small number.

For each boundary, we also use the ``FLOW_CONDITION`` card to specify boundary
conditions::

  FLOW_CONDITION left_face
    TYPE
      TEMPERATURE dirichlet
      LIQUID_FLUX neumann
      GAS_FLUX neumann
    /
    TEMPERATURE 1.d0 C
    LIQUID_FLUX 0.d0 m/yr
    GAS_FLUX 0.d0 m/yr
  END

  FLOW_CONDITION right_face
    TYPE
      ENERGY_FLUX neumann
      LIQUID_FLUX neumann
      GAS_FLUX neumann
    /
    ENERGY_FLUX +1.5 W/m^2
    LIQUID_FLUX 0.d0 m/yr
    GAS_FLUX 0.d0 m/yr
  END

At the ``left_face`` (or west face), we apply a ``dirichlet`` type temperature 
boundary condition of 1.0C. At the ``right_face`` (or east face), we apply a 
``neumann`` type heat flux boundary condition of -1.5 W/m^2. PFLOTRAN
convention means this is a positive value on the east face. Because we don't 
want any fluid or gas flow for this problem, we apply identical ``neumann`` 
type fluid and gas flux boundary conditions so that no fluid flux exists.

The ``INITIAL_CONDITION`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Similarly to the ``STRATA`` card, we use the ``INITIAL_CONDITION`` card to
link the initial condition we defined in the ``FLOW_CONDITION`` card to the
regions it is applied at::

  INITIAL_CONDITION initial_left
    REGION left
    FLOW_CONDITION initial
  END
  
  INITIAL_CONDITION initial_right
    REGION right
    FLOW_CONDITION initial
  END
  
Above, we've linked the ``initial`` flow condition to both regions ``left``
and ``right``, because we want the initial condition to be applied over the 
whole domain. We give the two ``INITIAL_CONDITION`` cards unique names.

The ``BOUNDARY_CONDITION`` Card
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Similarly to the ``STRATA`` card, we use the ``BOUNDARY_CONDITION`` card to
link the boundary conditions we defined in the ``FLOW_CONDITION`` card to the
regions they are applied at::

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION left_face
    REGION left_face
    FLOW_CONDITION left_face
  END

  BOUNDARY_CONDITION right_face
    REGION right_face
    FLOW_CONDITION right_face
  END

Above, we've linked the ``left_face`` flow condition to region ``left_face``, 
and the ``right_face`` flow condition to region ``right_face``. We also give
each of the ``BOUNDARY_CONDITION`` cards a unique name to differentiate
them.

The Python Script
=================
First, we must import the required packages,

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import sys

Next the default options are set. These are used if no option arguments are 
given when the python script is executed.

.. code-block:: python

   plot_flag = False
   print_error = True
   passing_crit = 2.  # [% error]
   
If option arguments are provided, they are read in next,

.. code-block:: python

   options = sys.argv[1:]
   num_options = len(options)
   for n in options:
     if n == 'print_error=false':
       print_error = False
     if n == 'print_error=true':
       print_error = True
     if n == 'plot_flag=false':
       plot_flag = False
     if n == 'plot_flag=true':
       plot_flag = True
       
We start by constructing the analytical solution. We want to calculate the 
temperature at the cell centers, because PFLOTRAN output is given at cell
centers. We also include the boundaries.

.. code-block:: python

   K1 = 100.  # [W/m-C]
   K2 = 300.  # [W/m-C]
   q = -1.5   # [W/m^2]
   L = 100.   # [m]
   x_soln = np.array([0.,5.,15.,25.,35.,45.,55.,65.,75.,85.,95.,100.])
   T_soln = np.zeros(11)
   k = -1
   for j in x_soln:
     k = k + 1
     if j <= (2.*L/5.):
       T_soln[k] = np.array( -((q/K1)*j) + 1. )
     else:
       T_soln[k] = np.array( -((q/K2)*j) + 1. + (q*(2.*L/5.)*((1/K2)-(1/K1))) )
   
Next, we read the output file that was generated by PFLOTRAN. The temperature
solution begins on the 77th line and ends on the 76th line. 
When we are done, we close the file.

.. code-block:: python

   f = open('1D_conduction_BC_1st_kind-001.vtk', 'r')
   for i, line in enumerate(f):
     if i == 76:
       temperature = line.strip() 
     elif i > 76:
       break
   f.close()
   
Now that we have the temperature output stored in ``temperature``, we can
use it to construct the PFLOTRAN solution array with boundary values.

.. code-block:: python

   T_pflotran = np.array(temperature.split())
   T_pflotran = T_pflotran.astype(np.float)
   x_pflotran = np.array([5.,15.,25.,35.,45.,55.,65.,75.,85.,95.])
   
   x_pflotran = np.concatenate(([0.],x_pflotran),axis=0)
   T_pflotran = np.concatenate(([1.],T_pflotran),axis=0)
   
The next step is to plot the PFLOTRAN solution against the analytical solution so
we can visually compare the two solutions. If the option to show the plot
is chosen, the script will show the generated plot.

.. code-block:: python

   plt.plot(x_pflotran,T_pflotran,'o',x_soln,T_soln)
   plt.xlabel('Distance (m)')
   plt.ylabel('Temperature (C)')
   plt.title('Analytical vs. PFLOTRAN Solution')
   plt.legend(('PFLOTRAN','analytical'),'best',numpoints=1)
   plt.savefig('comparison_plot.png')

   if plot_flag:
     plt.show()

Finally, we calculate the relative percent error between the analytical
solution and the PFLOTRAN solution. If the option to print the error at
each grid cell was chosen, the error prints to the screen. Based on the
passing criteria, a PASS or FAIL is printed to the screen.

.. code-block:: python

   percent_error = 100.0*(T_pflotran-T_soln)/T_soln
   max_percent_error = np.nanmax(abs(percent_error))
   if print_error:
     print 'Percent Error (temperature):'
     print percent_error
   print 'Maximum Error:'
   print max_percent_error

   if abs(max_percent_error) > passing_crit:
     print '-- Test FAIL --\n'
   else: 
     print '-- Test PASS --\n'
