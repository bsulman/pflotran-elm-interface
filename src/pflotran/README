Items that need to be implemented

1.  Hydrostatic boundary conditions
2.  Boundary velocities for including in cell centered velocity calcs
3.  Break through curves
4.  Checkpoints
5.  Create waypoints for each time in srcs/sink
6.  For boundary connections, sign of dist(3) will change with z axis is inverted
