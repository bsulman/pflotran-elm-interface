! Apparently the PETSc authors believe that Fortran 90 modules should ensure
! that PETSC_AVOID_DECLARATIONS and PETSC_AVOID_MPIF_H are defined when the
! PETSc header files are included.  I can get around this, though, by making
! the definitions in these headers private.

  ! It is VERY IMPORTANT to make sure that the above .h90 file gets included.
  ! Otherwise some very strange things will happen and PETSc will give no
  ! indication of what the problem is.
