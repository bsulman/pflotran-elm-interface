The tests in this directory are meant to test the regression test
manager itself rather than testing pflotran. They should be run
anytime someone is working on the test manager!

--- expected-fail.cfg ---

One concern is that we want to verify that the regression test manager
is actually reporting a failed test when it failed. The tests listed
in expected-fail.cfg are designed with this in mind.

The primary focus of this test suite is to setup tests that we expect
to fail and verify that the test manager catches the correct
failure. This is primairly done by modifying the contents of the gold
standard files to create failures in specific places. These tests are
name fail-XXXX. These tests should be run in verbose mode, and you
should verify that the reported failure corresponds to the name of the
test. For example the solution time test should fail in the wall time,
while the residual 2-norm shoud fail in the residual 2-norm:

fail-solution-time...
    FAIL: Transport:Time (seconds) : 99.99999999893264 > 1.0 [percent]

fail-solution-r2norm...
    FAIL: Transport:Residual 2-Norm : 9.000000000000002 > 0.001 [relative]
