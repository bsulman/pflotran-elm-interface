# The tests in this list are intended to test the regression test
# manager itself, rather than pflotran. The tests are designed to fail
# in a specific way, and should be checked everytime the regression
# test mananger is changed.
#
# run these tests with the --verbose flag and verify that the reported
# failure corresponds to the test name, i.e. fail-rate fails in the
# reaction rate comparison, fail-solution-time fails in the transport
# solution time.
