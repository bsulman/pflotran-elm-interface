\section{Introduction}

PFLOTRAN solves a system of generally nonlinear partial differential equations describing multiphase, multicomponent and multiscale reactive flow and transport in porous materials. The code is designed to run on massively parallel computing architectures as well as workstations and laptops (Hammond et al., 2011). Parallelization is achieved through domain decomposition using the PETSc (Port\-a\-ble Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) libraries for the parallelization framework  (Balay et al., 1997).
